    "description": "<p><strong>ABOUT US</strong></p><p>Stio® is an omni-channel mountain brand that designs, develops and sells beautiful, functional, and innovative apparel, footwear and other accessories infused with the soul of the mountain lifestyle. With headquarters in Jackson, Wyoming, Stio draws inspiration from the surrounding Teton Range and offers product via Stio.com, catalog, growing B2B business and its Mountain Studio® retail locations.</p><p>We live and love mountain life, and as such see ourselves as caretakers of the resources that provide it. We are proud partners of Protect Our Winters and the Conservation Alliance among many other organizations. We have a strong preferred materials platform, use Bluesign® approved textiles wherever possible, audit our supply chains for best practices, and operate our workplaces responsibly.</p><p>We think that outside is the best side and that you can’t improve on nature. It’s good for mind, body and soul, and it’s our responsibility to help enable access for all people, regardless of race, gender, beliefs, background or ability. We strive for inclusion at Stio and in our local and national communities.</p><p></p><p><strong>YOUR ROLE </strong></p><p>The Senior Marketing Analyst is a critical member of the Data &amp; Analytics team and serves as the domain expert in marketing and direct-to-consumer (DTC) sales channels. This role owns customer lifetime value modeling which drives performance marketing spend decisions and demand-based revenue forecasting. You will work closely with the Performance Marketing team and the broader Marketing and DTC teams as their go-to data resource. This may include projects related to e-commerce, retail, merchandising, etc. Additionally, you will partner with Finance to integrate financial guardrails and business strategy into your work. This is a full-stack analyst position with an end-to-end focus: starting with the end goal of helping stakeholders make better business decisions, the Senior Marketing Analyst will work up the stack and build the data infrastructure needed to make this possible. As an early member of a growing analytics team, the Senior Marketing Analyst will have the chance to make a broad, tangible impact on our infrastructure, analysis projects, processes, and culture.</p><p>We are looking for an experienced, detail-oriented analyst who can connect what they see in the data to the bigger picture. The right candidate is someone who doesn’t hesitate to sweep the floor (e.g., fix a broken Excel link), isn’t afraid to question the status quo (e.g., does this metric actually measure what is intended?), and has a strong bias for tying analysis to action. We want to hear from people who would rather quickly solve a pressing business problem with simple analysis than build a sophisticated machine learning model that collects dust. A foundation of technical skills and an interest in marketing analytics are essential, but even more important is an eagerness to learn new things and a desire to drive positive progress at Stio.</p><p>This is a remote role that is part of the Finance department and reports to the Senior Business Analyst.</p><p></p><p><strong>YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES </strong></p><ul style=\"\"> <li style=\"\">Provide analytical support to the Performance Marketing team for direct response marketing spend allocation. Work with Performance Marketing and Finance teams to optimize spend and ROI given operational and financial constraints.</li> <li style=\"\">Lead demand-based revenue forecasting for DTC channels, working closely with Finance, Performance Marketing, Ecommerce, Retail, and Inventory Planning teams.</li> <li style=\"\">Operate, maintain, and improve the foundational methodology and models that enable the two critical outputs above. This includes, but is not limited to: marketing attribution, customer lifetime value, and customer acquisition. Recommend where and when to transition existing tools to other data stack components, then lead the buildout and migration.</li> <li style=\"\">Design and deliver other analysis projects that drive better-informed decisions across Marketing and DTC teams (and sometimes other teams as needed).</li> <li style=\"\">Assist in building and maintaining Stio’s data infrastructure with a focus on ownership of sources, data, and business logic in the marketing and DTC domains. Our data stack currently consists of Fivetran, Microsoft Fabric, SQL/dbt, R, GitHub, and Power BI with many marketing analytics tools built in Excel using VBA.</li> <li style=\"\">Improve data governance, both internal to the Data &amp; Analytics team and external to other business users, by creating documentation for workflows and data objects.</li> <li style=\"\">Continuous learning to improve knowledge of technical best practices as well as knowledge of Marketing and DTC domains.</li> </ul><p></p><p><strong>YOUR SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE</strong> </p><ul style=\"\"><ul style=\"\"> <li style=\"\">4+ years of relevant experience as a marketing analyst, data analyst, or similar role</li> <li style=\"\">Advanced SQL skills (e.g., CTEs, window functions, and data wrangling)</li> <li style=\"\">Experience with cloud data warehouses (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery), data transformation tools (e.g., dbt), and version control (e.g., GitHub)</li> <li style=\"\">Experience with R or Python</li> <li style=\"\">Advanced Excel skills (e.g., pivot tables, various lookup functions, comfortable writing efficient formulas, easily-to-follow work)</li> <li style=\"\">Experience as a developer with at least one BI tool (e.g., Power BI, Tableau)</li> <li style=\"\">History of building collaborative and trusting relationships with supported stakeholders</li> <li style=\"\">Experience creating presentations and communicating analysis findings to leadership (verbally, written, and visually)</li> </ul></ul><p></p><p><strong>PREFERRED ADDITIONAL SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE</strong></p><p>Though not required, we would consider the following as an added plus:</p><ul style=\"\"> <li style=\"\">Experience with dbt and R</li> <li style=\"\">Experience with VBA</li> <li style=\"\">Experience with some of systems we use: Netsuite, Shopify, Google Analytics, Segment</li> <li style=\"\">Professional experience in marketing analytics at a DTC company</li> </ul><p></p><p><strong>THE FINE PRINT</strong></p><ul style=\"\"> <li style=\"\">Medical, Dental Vision plans</li> <li style=\"\">Company Paid Long Term Disability </li> <li style=\"\">Employee Assistance Program </li> <li style=\"\">401k with Match </li> <li style=\"\">Company DEI Committee</li> <li style=\"\">Generous paid time off policies</li> <li style=\"\">Gear test, perks, and more</li> </ul><p></p><p>We provide competitive compensation packages, inclusive of base pay, incentives and benefits. The base salary range for this role is $80,000-$90,000. It would not be typical for someone to be hired at the top end of the range for the role, as actual pay will be determined based on several factors including experience, skills and qualifications. </p><p></p><p>This job description is not necessarily an exhaustive list of all responsibilities, skills, duties, requirements, efforts, or working conditions associated with the job. While this is intended to be an accurate reflection of the current job, we reserve the right to revise the job or to require that other or different tasks be performed. Stio is an equal opportunity employer of all qualified individuals, including minorities, BIPOC, LGBTQ+, veterans &amp; individuals with disabilities.<br></p><br><br><div class=\"h2\">About the company</div><br><p>At Stio, we create gear that embodies the true essence of mountain life from our hometown of Jackson, Wyoming. Our elevated, responsibly designed styles range from the epic to the everyday and are inspired by an ecosystem that blends natural connection and active balance. We are rooted at the base of the Tetons so we can see mountains, access trailheads and hear spring creeks daily to feed our souls and keep us grounded. This shared mindset of nature, access and balance resonates far beyond our peaks and valley, directly to your mountain life community across distance, geography and topography.</p><img src=\"https://remotive.com/job/track/1986387/blank.gif?source=public_api\" alt=\"\"/>"
