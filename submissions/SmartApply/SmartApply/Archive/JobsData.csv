To ensure we are adhering to best practice and ethical guidelines in the field of mental health, we take care to avoid dual relationships.

Further, if Headspace cannot find a role that fails to resolve an ethical issue associated with a dual relationship, Headspace may need to take steps to ensure ethical obligations are being adhered to, including a delayed start date or a potential leave of absence. Such steps would be taken to protect both the former member, as well as any relevant individuals from their care team, from impairment, risk of exploitation, or harm.

Since 2017, Ro has helped millions of patients in nearly every single county in the United States, including 98% of primary care deserts. The healthcare system today is not designed to help patients achieve their goals. It’s designed around institutions such as hospitals and insurance companies.

We’re building healthcare that puts patients in control, provides reactive and proactive care, has transparent pricing and process, is extremely effective and ridiculously convenient, and evolves over time based on patients’ goals.

Senior Marketing Analyst,Stio,USA,"ABOUT US Stio® is an omni-channel mountain brand that designs, develops and sells beautiful, functional, and innovative apparel, footwear and other accessories infused with the soul of the mountain lifestyle. With headquarters in Jackson, Wyoming, Stio draws inspiration from the surrounding Teton Range and offers product via Stio.com, catalog, growing B2B business and its Mountain Studio® retail locations. We live and love mountain life, and as such see ourselves as caretakers of the resources that provide it. We are proud partners of Protect Our Winters and the Conservation Alliance among many other organizations. We have a strong preferred materials platform, use Bluesign® approved textiles wherever possible, audit our supply chains for best practices, and operate our workplaces responsibly. We think that outside is the best side and that you can’t improve on nature. It’s good for mind, body and soul, and it’s our responsibility to help enable access for all people, regardless of race, gender, beliefs, background or ability. We strive for inclusion at Stio and in our local and national communities. YOUR ROLE The Senior Marketing Analyst is a critical member of the Data & Analytics team and serves as the domain expert in marketing and direct-to-consumer (DTC) sales channels. This role owns customer lifetime value modeling which drives performance marketing spend decisions and demand-based revenue forecasting. You will work closely with the Performance Marketing team and the broader Marketing and DTC teams as their go-to data resource. This may include projects related to e-commerce, retail, merchandising, etc. Additionally, you will partner with Finance to integrate financial guardrails and business strategy into your work. This is a full-stack analyst position with an end-to-end focus: starting with the end goal of helping stakeholders make better business decisions, the Senior Marketing Analyst will work up the stack and build the data infrastructure needed to make this possible. As an early member of a growing analytics team, the Senior Marketing Analyst will have the chance to make a broad, tangible impact on our infrastructure, analysis projects, processes, and culture. We are looking for an experienced, detail-oriented analyst who can connect what they see in the data to the bigger picture. The right candidate is someone who doesn’t hesitate to sweep the floor (e.g., fix a broken Excel link), isn’t afraid to question the status quo (e.g., does this metric actually measure what is intended?), and has a strong bias for tying analysis to action. We want to hear from people who would rather quickly solve a pressing business problem with simple analysis than build a sophisticated machine learning model that collects dust. A foundation of technical skills and an interest in marketing analytics are essential, but even more important is an eagerness to learn new things and a desire to drive positive progress at Stio. This is a remote role that is part of the Finance department and reports to the Senior Business Analyst. YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES Provide analytical support to the Performance Marketing team for direct response marketing spend allocation. Work with Performance Marketing and Finance teams to optimize spend and ROI given operational and financial constraints. Lead demand-based revenue forecasting for DTC channels, working closely with Finance, Performance Marketing, Ecommerce, Retail, and Inventory Planning teams. Operate, maintain, and improve the foundational methodology and models that enable the two critical outputs above. This includes, but is not limited to: marketing attribution, customer lifetime value, and customer acquisition. Recommend where and when to transition existing tools to other data stack components, then lead the buildout and migration. Design and deliver other analysis projects that drive better-informed decisions across Marketing and DTC teams (and sometimes other teams as needed). Assist in building and maintaining Stio’s data infrastructure with a focus on ownership of sources, data, and business logic in the marketing and DTC domains. Our data stack currently consists of Fivetran, Microsoft Fabric, SQL/dbt, R, GitHub, and Power BI with many marketing analytics tools built in Excel using VBA. Improve data governance, both internal to the Data & Analytics team and external to other business users, by creating documentation for workflows and data objects. Continuous learning to improve knowledge of technical best practices as well as knowledge of Marketing and DTC domains. YOUR SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE 4+ years of relevant experience as a marketing analyst, data analyst, or similar role Advanced SQL skills (e.g., CTEs, window functions, and data wrangling) Experience with cloud data warehouses (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery), data transformation tools (e.g., dbt), and version control (e.g., GitHub) Experience with R or Python Advanced Excel skills (e.g., pivot tables, various lookup functions, comfortable writing efficient formulas, easily-to-follow work) Experience as a developer with at least one BI tool (e.g., Power BI, Tableau) History of building collaborative and trusting relationships with supported stakeholders Experience creating presentations and communicating analysis findings to leadership (verbally, written, and visually) PREFERRED ADDITIONAL SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE Though not required, we would consider the following as an added plus: Experience with dbt and R Experience with VBA Experience with some of systems we use: Netsuite, Shopify, Google Analytics, Segment Professional experience in marketing analytics at a DTC company THE FINE PRINT Medical, Dental Vision plans Company Paid Long Term Disability Employee Assistance Program 401k with Match Company DEI Committee Generous paid time off policies Gear test, perks, and more We provide competitive compensation packages, inclusive of base pay, incentives and benefits. The base salary range for this role is $80,000-$90,000.

Data Scientist,Goodparty,USA,"Overview We are looking for a part-time (20-30 hours/week) data scientist or data analyst to contract with us on building internal reporting dashboards in Tableau for GoodParty.org , where our mission is to make people matter more than money in our democracy . This role is primarily focused on dashboard development and minor data transformation, supporting various teams across the organization. You will work with an existing data science contractor and collaborate with team leads as key stakeholders. This is a contract position for 4-6 weeks depending on start date, with the potential to extend. About GoodParty.org : GoodParty.org is empowering Independents to run, win, and serve so we can transform civic leadership. In 2024, we helped elect 3,444 Independent candidates into local offices across 48 states. Why? Americans – especially young people – have been losing faith in democracy. The rigged, two-party system has turned “Independent” into a dirty word. Voters are trapped between choosing the lesser of two evils or sitting out elections altogether. A majority of eligible voters (over 130M Americans), including more than half of Millennials and Gen Z, say that neither Republicans nor Democrats represent them. But they keep getting re-elected! Whether you’re concerned about healthcare costs, wars, the environment, our individual freedoms, or inequality, many great solutions are held back by the dark doom loop of dysfunctional partisan politics. While mainstream media and the two major parties focus on federal elections (Congress and the President), GoodParty.org is building from the bottom up. With over 500,000 elected offices in the United States—70% of which are uncontested—GoodParty.org is powering the movement to reclaim our communities from career politicians. We’re helping independents in local and state-level campaigns nationwide. Together, we’re building a truly representative democracy where society’s biggest problems are solved. How? GoodParty.org empowers independents to run, win, and serve in public office without the influence of partisan or big-money support. Through our free, AI-powered tools, we enable independent candidates to prioritize people over parties and community over corporate funding, transforming real people into civic heroes. We’re a platform, not a political party. And, it’s working! Starting with 11 wins in the 2023 election cycle, GoodParty.org set an audacious goal for 1,000 wins in 2024. We beat expectations – 3,444 candidates won this past November and are serving in office across 48 states! 40.3 million voters (26% of all 2024 voters) cast a ballot for our 6,317 candidates. Our general election win rate was 54.5%. Looking ahead, we’re building on our momentum and expanding our product offerings to help candidates deliver on their promises and serve their constituents effectively. Candidates who partner with us come from across the ideological spectrum and pledge to uphold people-powered principles, anti-corruption practices, and a commitment to civility. Together, we aim to transform civic leadership, bringing real accountability to public service and setting a new standard of leaders who prioritize the people they serve. GoodParty.org is founded by serial entrepreneur, Farhad Mohit , with over $1B in exits — Flipagram (now TikTok), Shopzilla, and BizRate. What you’ll do: Develop and refine internal-facing Tableau dashboards based on stakeholder requirements. Perform minor data transformations to ensure data is visualization-ready (may involve direct work in Databricks, PostgreSQL, or dbt). Assist with wireframing dashboard layouts and interpreting metrics. Collaborate with team leads and the data science contractor to align dashboards with organizational goals. Test and iterate on visualizations to optimize usability and insight delivery for cross-functional teams. Who you are: Strong expertise in Tableau, with a focus on building dashboards and applying data visualization best practices. 3+ years experience as a data analyst or data scientist. Experience with tools like Databricks, PostgreSQL, or dbt for light data transformation tasks. Familiarity with Figma, Balsamiq, or similar wireframing tools for designing dashboard layouts. Comfort with developing and refining internal Tableau dashboards based on stakeholder needs. Ability to thrive in a part-time contractor role, committing 20-30 hours per week for a minimum of 4 weeks, with potential for extension. Bonus if: You have familiarity with political/election reporting metrics You have worked at a data-driven startup You have experience studying, working, or volunteering in politics, political activism, or democracy reform You’re sick of sitting on the sidelines watching our democracy fail to meet its potential Why you should work at GoodParty.org : Join us in solving the biggest problem of our time – fixing our democracy – so all other problems can be solved. We’re a Public Benefit Corporation that prioritizes social impact over making money. Work where and how you like, on a fully remote team spread across the country. Join a passionate team with diverse political views focused on one mission. We’re fully funded for our mission. No stressing over whether the next round of funding will come through.
