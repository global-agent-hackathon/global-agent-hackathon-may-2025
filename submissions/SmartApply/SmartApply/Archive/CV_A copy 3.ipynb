With over five years of experience in data analytics and product data analysis, I have developed expertise in transforming complex data into actionable insights that drive customer-centric solutions and business growth. My background in leading innovative experiments, designing predictive dashboards, and building internal AI tools aligns well with Blacklane’s commitment to leveraging data for exceptional mobility experiences.  \\n\\nAt Rapido, I led experiments that resulted in a 5% boost in user retention through a ScratchCard experiment, exemplifying my ability to harness A/B testing and data-driven strategies for measurable impact. During my tenure at Allianz, I crafted comprehensive Power BI dashboards that successfully steered sales initiatives across 119 countries, improving decision-making efficiency at a global scale. Additionally, I developed AllianzGPT, an internal knowledge base powered by LangChain and OpenAI, facilitating seamless information access for thousands of employees and enhancing internal productivity. These projects underscore my ability to combine technical skills—SQL, Python, Power BI, and Metabase—with innovative thinking to deliver value.  \\n\\nI am particularly drawn to Blacklane’s innovative spirit and customer-first philosophy. I am confident that my skills in analytics, experimentation, and AI implementation will contribute effectively to your team’s efforts in optimizing platform performance and elevating customer experience. I am eager to bring my passion for data and my proven track record of delivering impactful insights to Blacklane’s dynamic environment.  \\n\\nThank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background and skills can support Blacklane’s continued success and innovation.  \\n\\nSincerely,  \\nRaviteja R', content_type='str', thinking=None, reasoning_content='## Drafting Cover Letter\\nStart by structuring the cover letter with an engaging introduction, highlighting key achievements, connecting skills to the Blacklane role, and a compelling closing.\\nAction: begin\\n\\n', event='RunResponse', messages=[Message(role='system', content='<your_role>\\nCraft world-class, ready-to-submit cover letters\\n</your_role>\\n\\n<instructions>\\n- GENERAL RULES:\\n- 1.

No unnecessary information like street address if missing.\\n</instructions>\\n\\n<additional_information>\\n- Use markdown to format your answers.\\n</additional_information>\\n\\n<reasoning_instructions>\\nYou have access to the `think` and `analyze` tools to work through problems step-by-step and structure your thought process. You must ALWAYS `think` before making tool calls or generating a response.\\n\\n1. **Think** (scratchpad):\\n    - Purpose: Use the `think` tool as a scratchpad to break down complex problems, outline steps, and decide on immediate actions within your reasoning flow. Use this to structure your internal monologue.\\n    - Usage: Call `think` before making tool calls or generating a response. Explain your reasoning and specify the intended action (e.g., \"make a tool call\", \"perform calculation\", \"ask clarifying question\").\\n\\n2. **Analyze** (evaluation):\\n    - Purpose: Evaluate the result of a think step or a set of tool calls. Assess if the result is expected, sufficient, or requires further investigation.\\n    - Usage: Call `analyze` after a set of tool calls. Determine the `next_action` based on your analysis: `continue` (more reasoning needed), `validate` (seek external confirmation/validation if possible), or `final_answer` (ready to conclude).\\n    - Explain your reasoning highlighting whether the result is correct/sufficient.\\n\\n## IMPORTANT GUIDELINES\\n- **Always Think First:** You MUST use the `think` tool before making tool calls or generating a response.\\n- **Iterate to Solve:** Use the `think` and `analyze` tools iteratively to build a clear reasoning path. The typical flow is `Think` -> [`Tool Calls` if needed] -> [`Analyze` if needed] -> ... -> `final_answer`. Repeat this cycle until you reach a satisfactory conclusion.\\n- **Make multiple tool calls in parallel:** After a `think` step, you can make multiple tool calls in parallel.\\n- **Keep Thoughts Internal:** The reasoning steps (thoughts and analyses) are for your internal process only. Do not share them directly with the user.\\n- **Conclude Clearly:** When your analysis determines the `next_action` is `final_answer`, provide a concise and accurate final answer to the user.\\n</reasoning_instructions>', name=None, tool_call_id=None, tool_calls=None, audio=None, images=None, videos=None, files=None, audio_output=None, image_output=None, thinking=None,
