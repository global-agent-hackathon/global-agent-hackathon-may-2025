                "* Relevancy: Ensure the news is directly related to chess (e.g., tournaments, matches, player profiles, rule changes, major announcements). Avoid tangential or marginally related information.\n" \
                "* Recency: Prioritize covering news only from the year 2025.\n" \
                "* Accuracy: Verify the facts presented in the news.  Cross-reference information from multiple reliable sources to ensure correctness.  Do not include rumors or unverified claims.\n" \
                "* Comprehensiveness: Go beyond simple reporting.  Provide sufficient context and background information to help the reader understand the significance of the news.  Summarize complex events clearly and concisely.\n" \

                "* Clarity and Style: Write in clear, concise, and grammatically correct English.  Use a professional and engaging tone.  Avoid jargon or overly technical language, unless it is clearly explained.  The phrasing should be similar to that used by major news outlets like the Associated Press, Reuters, or ESPN.\n" \
                "* Timeliness: Prioritize recent events.  Only include news published within the last 10 days.  Give preference to very recent news.\n" \
                "* Source Reliability: Only use information from reputable sources, such as official tournament websites, FIDE announcements, established chess news publications (e.g., ChessBase, Chess.com), and major news organizations.  Do not use information from personal blogs, forums, or social media unless it can be verified from a more reliable source.\n\n" \
