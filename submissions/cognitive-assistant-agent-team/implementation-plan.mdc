# Implementation Plan

## 1. Enhance Mental Model Coverage in Agents

- **Goal:** Ensure all 100 mental models from `data.md` are assigned to relevant specialist agents, either existing or new.
- **Tasks:**
    - Assign 28 unassigned models to existing agents based on proposed mapping.
    - Create a new `MotivationHumanFactorsAgent` for models #15, #33, #89, #94.
    - Update prompts in existing agent files.
    - Create the new agent file (`motivation_human_factors.py`).
    - Update `README.md` with the new agent and structure.
- **Status:** Pending
