# Project Title
Cognitive Assistant Agent Team

## Overview of the Idea
An AI system composed of specialized agents that proactively observe user input (text, problems, documents), identify opportunities to apply relevant mental models, and offer insights, questions, or alternative framings to enhance the user's thinking, analysis, and decision-making, without requiring explicit model requests. It uses a team of specialized agents coordinated by a central agent.

## Project Goal
To demonstrate a cognitive assistant agent team that leverages specialized agents and mental models to help users improve their thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making processes through interactive dialogue.

## How It Works
Provide a step-by-step explanation or high-level breakdown of your Agentic System and how users will interact with it:

- **User Flow**:
    1. User provides a query or problem description via a command-line interface.
    2. The input is sent to the `agno.team.Team` instance running in `coordinate` mode.
    3. The `CoordinatorAgent` receives the input and analyzes it.
    4. Guided by its instructions, the Coordinator determines if specialist agent expertise is needed.
    5. If delegation is required, the Coordinator addresses the relevant specialist agent(s) directly by name in its internal reasoning (e.g., "Asking `decision_risk_agent` about potential downsides...").
    6. The `agno` framework routes the task to the named specialist agent(s).
    7. Specialist agents process their assigned sub-tasks and return their responses.
    8. The `CoordinatorAgent` receives the responses from the specialists.
    9. The Coordinator synthesizes the specialist insights with its own analysis.
    10. The final, comprehensive response is streamed back to the user's command line.
- **Core Functionality**:
    *   Analyze user queries related to decision-making, problem-solving, strategy, etc.
    *   Apply relevant mental models via specialized agents:
        *   `decision_risk_agent`: Decision-making, risk assessment.
        *   `problem_solving_innovation_agent`: Problem-solving, creativity.
        *   `systems_complexity_agent`: Systems thinking, complex interactions.
        *   `bias_psychology_agent`: Cognitive biases, psychology.
        *   `strategy_competition_agent`: Strategy, market analysis.
        *   `learning_communication_agent`: Learning, communication.
        *   `efficiency_process_agent`: Process improvement, habits.
    *   Coordinate the workflow between the user and specialist agents.
    *   Synthesize information from multiple agents into a coherent response.
    *   Provide reasoning steps and justifications (leveraging `ReasoningTools`).
- **Multimodal Elements** (if applicable): Text-only currently.

## Tools Used
- **Core Framework**: `agno` (`agno.team.Team`, `agno.agent.Agent`, `agno.models.openrouter.OpenRouter`)
- **LLM Provider**: OpenRouter (via `agno.models.openrouter`)
- **Configuration**: `python-dotenv`
- **Standard Libraries**: `os`, `textwrap`
- **Utility**: `pydantic`
- **Reasoning**: `agno.tools.reasoning.ReasoningTools`
- **Specialized Agents**: Custom agent classes defined in `agents/` (e.g., `CoordinatorAgent`, `DecisionRiskAgent`, etc.)

## UI Approach
Command-line interface (CLI) using Python's `input()` and `print()`, with streaming responses for better user experience.

## Visuals
N/A (Command-line interface)

┃                                                                                                                                                      ┃
┃ Given the market dynamics, user engagement decline, and competitor disruption, here are strategic considerations:                                    ┃
┃                                                                                                                                                      ┃
┃  • If AlphaMetric's core strengths and brand support a premium positioning with loyal users willing to pay for advanced features, a carefully        ┃
┃    planned major overhaul emphasizing differentiated features and user experience innovations (such as AI personalization and gamification) could    ┃
┃    revitalize engagement. Close risk-monitoring and staged rollout can manage uncertainties.                                                         ┃
┃  • If your user feedback strongly indicates demand for simplicity and you have capacity to develop BetaSimple in 3 months, it could capture an       ┃
┃    underserved segment and hedge against freemium competition. However, brand management and clear market segmentation must be prioritized to avoid  ┃
┃    cannibalization.                                                                                                                                  ┃
┃  • Strategic partnerships can complement either path by expanding market reach and sharing risks, especially if aligned with partners bringing       ┃
┃    complementary capabilities or user bases.                                                                                                         ┃
┃  • Considering innovative monetization and engagement models alongside any chosen path will strengthen market fit and retention.                     ┃
┃                                                                                                                                                      ┃
┃ Would you like assistance to construct decision trees with quantified probabilities, develop an implementation roadmap for any option, or further    ┃
┃ explore innovative ideas in detail?                                                                                                                  ┃
┃                                                                                                                                                      ┃

## Additional Notes
- The project utilizes a coordinator-specialist agent architecture within the `agno` framework.
- Delegation relies on the `coordinate` mode of `agno.team.Team`, where the coordinator addresses specialists by name.
- Uses OpenRouter for LLM access, allowing flexibility in model choice.
- Includes `ReasoningTools` to enhance transparency.
