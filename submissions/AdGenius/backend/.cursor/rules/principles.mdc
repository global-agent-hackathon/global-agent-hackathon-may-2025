## Architectural Principles

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD):** The backend is organized according to DDD principles. Each domain's code should reside in its own domain package within `backend/`, ensuring clear separation of business logic by domain.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** We follow TDD practices. Test cases must be written before implementing business logic. Tests should be placed alongside the business logic file or in a `tests` folder within the relevant domain package.
