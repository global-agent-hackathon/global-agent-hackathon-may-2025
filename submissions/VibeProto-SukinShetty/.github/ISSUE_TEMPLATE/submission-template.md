## Project Title
VibeProto: Natural Language Prototyping for Non-Coders

## Overview of the Idea
VibeProto is a tool that lets non-technical people like me create web app prototypes and Python scripts using simple prompts. It uses AI to turn ideas into code, solving the problem of coding being hard for non-coders. Whether it’s a to-do list or a file renamer, it makes tech accessible!

## Project Goal
The goal is to democratize software development, enabling anyone—regardless of coding skills to build prototypes and automate tasks with Python scripts. VibeProto aims to prove that AI can bridge the gap for non-coders.

How It Works
User Flow:
1. Users access a chat-like interface.
2. They input a prompt (e.g., "Create a to-do list web app with add and delete functionality").
3. Agno enhances the prompt for better specificity (e.g., adding UI details).
4. The system generates and displays the code, which users can run.
Core Functionality:
1. OpenAI Codex generates code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript for web apps; Python for scripts).
2. Agno enhances prompts with reasoning, ensuring the output aligns with user intent.
3. With help of Agno memory capabilities users preferences will be stored and adopted (USP).
Multimodal Elements: Currently text-based; by end of the hackathon will include image or sketch inputs for intuitive prototyping.

-Tools Used
OpenAI Codex: Code generation.
Agno: Prompt enhancement and reasoning.
OpenAI API

UI Approach
The interface is a chat-based system where users converse with the AI as they would with a developer. It’s designed for simplicity, with future plans for visual editors or drag-and-drop customization.

Team Members: None (solo project)
Background/Experience: Non-coder turned AI Buider. I am also an AI Educator. I built VibeProto to make software creation as intuitive as a conversation. Using tools like Codex and Agno, I'm passionate about bringing coding to everyone.I have been using AI to build AI Tech products since a year now.
