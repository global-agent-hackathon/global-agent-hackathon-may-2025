    # User Story Enhancement Process

        Transform the provided rough user story into a comprehensive, customer-focused user story 
        that follows Agile best practices. Your goal is to create a user story that provides 
        context and value, not just a list of technical tasks or features.

        ## 1. Core User Story Structure
        Ensure the user story includes the three essential components:
        - **WHO** - As a [specific user type/role]
        - **WHAT** - I want [clear intention or capability]
        - **WHY** - So that [explicit value or benefit received]

        Make these elements specific, clear, and customer-focused.

        ## 2. Story Elaboration
        Add a brief elaboration section that provides:
        - Additional context about the user's situation
        - Clarification of terminology if needed
        - Business value explanation
        - Any constraints or assumptions

        ## 3. Acceptance Criteria
        Create clear acceptance criteria that:
        - Define when the story is considered "done"
        - Are testable and verifiable
        - Cover both functional and non-functional requirements
        - Consider edge cases and potential issues

        Avoid including development process steps (like "code review completed") in acceptance criteria.

        ## 4. Implementation Notes (Optional)
        Include any helpful technical context that might assist developers without prescribing the solution:
        - Technical considerations
        - Potential approaches
        - Related components/systems
        - Security or performance considerations

        ## 5. Story Size
        Ensure the story is appropriately sized:
        - Small enough to be completed in a single sprint
        - Focused on a single piece of functionality
        - Can be estimated by the development team

        ## Output Format
        Structure the enhanced user story with clear headings:

        ```
        # User Story: [Brief Title]

        ## Story Definition
        As a [specific user type/role],
        I want [clear intention or capability],
        So that [explicit value or benefit received].

    Analyze the provided user story, paying close attention to its acceptance criteria.
    Your goal is to generate a set of comprehensive, detailed, and industry-standard
    manual test cases that directly verify the functionality described in the user
    story and its acceptance criteria.

        Ensure the test cases cover all relevant scenarios derived from the user story and
        its acceptance criteria, including:
        -   Positive flows (happy path).
        -   Negative scenarios (invalid input, error conditions).
        -   Edge cases (extreme ends of input ranges).
        -   Boundary conditions (values at boundaries of valid/invalid ranges).

        For each test case, provide the following information in a clear, precise, and
        structured format, adhering to industry best practices. The detail level should
        be sufficient for a manual tester to execute the test steps without ambiguity
        and for an SDET to use it as a basis for automation:

        -   **Test Case ID:** A unique identifier (e.g., TC_US_[UserStoryID/Ref]_[SequenceNumber]). Link implicitly to the user story being tested.
        -   **Test Case Title:** A clear, concise, and action-oriented title summarizing the specific scenario being tested (e.g., "Verify successful login with valid credentials").
        -   **Description:** A brief explanation of what this specific test case verifies, explicitly linking it back to the relevant part of the user story or an acceptance criterion.
        -   **Preconditions:** Any necessary setup or state required before executing the test steps. Be specific and actionable (e.g., "User account 'testuser' exists with password 'password123'", "Application is open and the login page is displayed").
        -   **Test Steps:** A numbered list of explicit, unambiguous, and actionable steps a manual tester must follow. Each step should describe a single user action or system interaction. Be highly specific about UI elements and expected immediate system responses or UI changes. Include specific test data directly within the steps where it is used, or clearly reference it from the Test Data field.
            *   Example: "1. Navigate to the Login page (URL: https://myapp.com/login)."
            *   Example: "2. In the 'Username' input field, enter the value 'valid_user'."
            *   Example: "3. In the 'Password' input field, enter the value 'correct_password'."
            *   Example: "4. Click the 'Sign In' button."
        -   **Expected Result:** A clear, specific, and verifiable outcome after performing *all* the test steps. Describe the exact expected state of the system, UI changes, messages displayed (including exact text if possible), data updates, navigation, or other observable results. This should directly map to the "Then" part of the acceptance criteria scenarios where applicable.
            *   Example: "The user is successfully logged in and redirected to the Dashboard page (URL: https://myapp.com/dashboard)."
            *   Example: "An error message 'Invalid username or password' is displayed beneath the login form."
        -   **Test Data:** List any specific data required for this test case if not fully described within the steps. Specify data types or formats if relevant (e.g., Valid Username: "testuser", Invalid Password: "wrongpass123").
        -   **Priority:** Assign a priority level (e.g., High, Medium, Low) based on the criticality of the functionality and the likelihood/impact of defects in this scenario.
        -   **Status:** Initialize the status as 'Not Executed'.
        -   **Postconditions:** (Optional) Any cleanup or system state expected after the test case execution (e.g., "User is logged out," "Test data is cleaned up"). Include only if necessary for clarifying the end state.

        Present the generated test cases in a markdown table format as specified in the expected output. Ensure the table is well-formatted, easy to read, and contains all the specified columns. The level of detail in the steps and expected results is crucial for enabling unambiguous manual execution and supporting subsequent automation efforts.

    Analyze the provided input, which is a set of detailed manual test cases.
    Each manual test case represents a specific scenario or example of how the
    system should behave based on the original user story and its acceptance criteria.

        Your task is to convert these manual test cases into comprehensive and
        well-structured Gherkin scenarios and scenario outlines within a single
        Feature file.

        **Best Practices for Gherkin Generation:**

        1.  **Feature Description:** Start the output with a clear and concise `Feature:` description that summarizes the overall functionality being tested. This should align with the user story's main goal.
        2.  **Scenario vs. Scenario Outline:**
            *   Use a `Scenario:` for individual test cases that cover a unique flow or specific set of inputs/outcomes.
            *   Use a `Scenario Outline:` when multiple manual test cases cover the *same* workflow or steps but with *different test data* (inputs and potentially expected simple outcomes). Extract the varying data into an `Examples:` table below the Scenario Outline and use placeholders (< >) in the steps. This promotes the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
        3.  **Descriptive Titles:** Use clear, concise, and action-oriented titles for both `Scenario` and `Scenario Outline`, derived from the manual test case titles or descriptions. The title should quickly convey the purpose of the scenario.
        4.  **Tags:** Apply relevant and meaningful `@tags` above each Scenario or Scenario Outline (e.g., `@smoke`, `@regression`, `@login`, `@negative`, `@boundary`). Consider tags based on the test case type, priority, or related feature area to aid in test execution filtering and reporting.
        5.  **Structured Steps (Given/When/Then/And/But):**
            *   `Given`: Describe the initial context or preconditions required to perform the test (e.g., "Given the user is logged in", "Given the product is out of stock"). These set the scene. Avoid user interaction details here.
            *   `When`: Describe the specific action or event that triggers the behavior being tested (e.g., "When the user adds the item to the cart", "When invalid credentials are provided"). There should ideally be only one main `When` per scenario.
            *   `Then`: Describe the expected outcome or result after the action is performed. This verifies the behavior (e.g., "Then the item should appear in the cart", "Then an error message should be displayed"). This should directly map to the Expected Result in the manual test case.
            *   `And` / `But`: Use these to extend a previous Given, When, or Then step. `And` is typically for additive conditions or actions, while `But` can be used for negative conditions (though `And not` is often clearer). Limit the number of `And` steps to maintain readability.
        6.  **Level of Abstraction (What, Not How):** Write Gherkin steps at a high level, focusing on the *intent* and *behavior* (what the system does or what the user achieves) rather than the technical implementation details (how it's done, e.g., "click button X", "fill field Y"). Abstract away UI interactions where possible.
        7.  **Clarity and Readability:** Use plain, unambiguous language that is easy for both technical and non-technical team members to understand. Avoid technical jargon. Maintain consistent phrasing. Use empty lines to separate scenarios for better readability.
        8.  **Background:** If multiple scenarios within the feature file share the same initial preconditions, consider using a `Background:` section at the top of the feature file. This reduces repetition but ensure it doesn't make scenarios harder to understand.
        9.  **Traceability (Optional but Recommended):** If the manual test cases reference user story or requirement IDs (e.g., Jira IDs), you can include these as tags or comments (using `#`) near the Feature or Scenario title for traceability.

        Convert each relevant manual test case into one or more Gherkin scenarios/scenario outlines based on the above principles. Ensure the generated Gherkin accurately reflects the preconditions, steps, and expected results described in the manual test cases, while elevating the level of abstraction.

        **IMPORTANT:** Your final output MUST be ONLY the markdown code block containing the Gherkin feature file content. Do not include any other text, explanations, or tool calls before or after the code block.
