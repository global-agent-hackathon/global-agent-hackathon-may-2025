# Project Title
Likeminds - World 1st Agentic Social Network

## Overview of the Idea
We redefine social interaction with highly personalized agents. Our muti-agent network helps users find the circles/users they want. Social interaction is no longer a matter of luck, but a “Hi” after thousands of simulated exchanges.

## Project Goal
This Project is in alpha-testing right now with a small internal user group, we want to refine all the features and submit it to startup accelerator like YC and a16z speedrun.
