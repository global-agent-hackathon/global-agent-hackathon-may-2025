# Project Title

Likeminds - Agentic Multi-Social Semantic Network

## Overview of the Idea

- 🌐 Likeminds is a **semantic** network exploration tool and it allows the users to visually discover and navigate profiles of people relevant to a specific topic, institution, or field.

- 🔗 Unlike plain old searching or searching on social graphs which rely on follower/following data, Likeminds builds connections using semantic similarity derived from various categories such as affiliations, areas of expertise, background, etc.

- 📊 The Top 8 (this is a variable which can be set by the user) profiles are displayed as an interactive graph, where further Deep Research can be performed on that specific user, expanding the graph even further.

## Project Goal🎯

To build a robust, intuitive and interactive system that helps users discover and explore like-minded individuals through semantic relationships efficiently — allowing knowledge discovery, academic exploration, and talent scouting, all without requiring access to multiple social media networks or private connections in a fraction of the time.

## Problems Likeminds is solving

1. 🔍 **Fragmented Discovery Across Platforms:**  
   Currently, finding like-minded individuals requires jumping between LinkedIn, Twitter, Google Scholar, GitHub, etc. There's no unified interface for exploring people across platforms.

2. ⏱️ **Slow and Manual Research Workflow**  
   Manually researching people is time-consuming - trust us we know! Likeminds simplifies this into a fast, visual exploration experience.

3. 🚫 **Limited Visibility Without Social Graphs**  
   Traditional platforms rely on follower/following data, making it hard to discover new profiles outside your immediate network.

4. 👨‍👨‍👦‍👦 **No Semantic Grouping or Similarity Awareness**  
   Existing tools lack the ability to understand and group people by deeper factors like shared interests, background, or expertise.

5. 📋 **Static, Linear Search Interfaces**  
   Search results are often shown in plain lists, offering no way to explore relationships or dive deeper into similar profiles.

6. 🌀 **Overwhelming Information Without Structure**  
   When relevant people are found, there’s no structured view to make sense of how they relate to you or others.

## How It Works

1. **Create a cloned agent of yourself:**

   - You provide your Social Media links as well as any other documents you have and then your specilazed agent will retrive all the information, remember all your experiences and analyzes your personality in the background.

2. **Personality Analysis:**
   - Once the agent has analyzed everything about you, it displays its analysis to you in a well-structured aesthetic format:

3. **Robust and Scemantic Exploration acorss Multiple Social Media:**

   - The user can now send any request, even very niche requests with multiple conditions such as "People who worked in UCL and submitted research papers at ICRA conference", etc. Your personalized agent will then start scanning across multiple social-medias and wesbites:

4. **Profiles are Retrieved and Displayed as a graph:**

   - Once all of the Profiles are retrieved (in the below example we have set a limit of 8 people) from different websites and social medias, they are displayed as an intereactive graph.

5. **Viewable Avatars:**
